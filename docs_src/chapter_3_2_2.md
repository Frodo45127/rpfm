# Global Search

`Global Search` allows you to perform a simple search (accepts Regex) across every DB/Loc/Text PackedFile inside your PackFile (and the schema of the currently selected game), providing you with a filterable list of results in the right of the screen.

Pretty straightforward, just some notes:
- The search field will turn red/green depending if your text is a valid regex or not (if you enabled the regex option).
- Replacing a result will close its PackedFile if open (To be fixed in a future update).
- Schema fields are not replazable.
