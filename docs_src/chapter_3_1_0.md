# Menu Bar

First, the top Menu bar. It has five menus in it, that'll be explained in the following chapters. But to give you an idea of what we have:
- `PackFile`: It's where all the *basic* stuff like `New`, `Open` and `Save` is. Pretty straightforward.
- `MyMod`: It's where all the stuff related with the use of the `MyMod` feature is.
- `View`: It's where you can hide/show certain panels of the UI.
- `Game Selected`: It's where you select the game you are modding the current PackFile for if RPFM failed to select it for you.
- `Special Stuff`: It's where weird stuff goes.
- `About`: It's where you go when you want to read this documentation, check the Patreon, or check what version of RPFM you have.
- `Debug`: Stay away from this.
And now, let's begin!
