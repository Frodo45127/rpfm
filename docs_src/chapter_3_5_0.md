# Dependencies Panel

`Dependencies` panel allows you to quickly access any vanilla/parent file from RPFM, without having to load it to an open PackFile. It also allows you to import them to the currently open PackFile, and extract them to the filesystem. Only works if the dependencies cache has been generated.
