# Rusted PackFile Manager
***Rusted PackFile Manager*** (RPFM) is a... reimplementation in Rust and ***~~GTK3~~ Qt5*** of ***PackFile Manager*** (PFM), one of the best modding tools for Total War Games.

# Status of the Project
RPFM currently supports **all Total War Games since Empire Total War**. Improvements are done every week, and contributions, either by schema update, translation, code or docs are welcome!

# Requirements (to use)
* ***Windows***: Just download it, extract it somewhere and execute it.
* ***Linux***: Make sure you have Qt5 5.14 or higher, xz, and 7zip installed. DDS files also require you to have the Qt5 Imageformats DDS library installed.
* ***MacOS***: You'll know it when I manage to compile it for Mac.

Also, the manual is [***HERE, READ IT BEFORE ASKING***][Manual].

# Requirements (to build)

# FAQ
- **Why not helping with PFM instead of reimplementing it?**: because I wanted to learn a new language, and I already now a bit of C#. Also, where is the fun of that?
- **Why the code quality is not the very best?**: because I'm using this project to learn Rust, and I'm constantly rewriting code as I find new and better ways to write it.
- **How can I translate it to my own language?**: go to the locale folder, copy the *English_en.ftl* file, rename it to *NameYouWantInTheUI_xx.ftl*. For example, for spanish it'll be *Espa√±ol_es.ftl*. Translate it. Done.
- **Why there is no .exe in the download?**: because you downloaded the source code, not the program. Check at the begining of this description, where is says ***Downloads here***.
