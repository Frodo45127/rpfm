# Rusted PackFile Manager
***Rusted PackFile Manager*** (RPFM) is a... reimplementation in Rust and ***~~GTK3~~ Qt5*** of ***PackFile Manager*** (PFM), one of the best modding tools for Total War Games. Not only it can edit Packs, but also has integrated editors for DB Tables, Loc files, scripts,... and a bunch of different file formats.

# Requirements (to use)
* ***Windows***: Just download it, extract it somewhere and execute it.
* ***Linux***:
    - ***Arch Linux and derivates***: it's in the AUR as **rpfm-bin**.
    - ***Other distros***: Make sure you have Qt5 5.14 or higher, xz, and 7zip installed. DDS files also require you to have the Qt5 Imageformats DDS library installed.
* ***MacOS***: You'll know it when I manage to compile it for Mac.

# Requirements (to build)

Check the building instructions [here][CompInst]

# FAQ
- **How can I translate it to my own language?**: go to the locale folder, copy the *English_en.ftl* file, rename it to *NameYouWantInTheUI_xx.ftl*. For example, for spanish it'll be *Espa√±ol_es.ftl*. Translate it. Done.
- **Why there is no .exe in the download?**: because you downloaded the source code, not the program. Check at the begining of this description, where is says ***Downloads here***.
